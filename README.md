# Silencio: Shakespeare Text Sharing App with Blockchain

## Introduction

Welcome to Silencio, a proof-of-concept (POC) demo application that showcases a Shakespeare text sharing platform using blockchain technology. In this fictional scenario, Shakespeare's works are not publicly available but scattered across various private libraries worldwide. The race is on to build the best Shakespeare bot, as the most valuable assets in this world are great plays with exceptional language, and Shakespeare is considered the best.

Teams searching for bits of Shakespeare data have formed a data sharing consortium. They contribute text segments and, based on their contribution, gain access to an equal amount of text from other members. An AI judge is installed to rate and evaluate the quality of the submitted Shakespeare text segments.

## Consortium Members

For this POC demo, we will have two consortium members sharing Shakespeare text data:

1. **The Globe Theater**: Known for their extensive collection of Shakespeare's early works.
2. **Stratford Library**: Famous for housing rare Shakespearean manuscripts and historical documents.

## Application Overview

Silencio is a single-page Next.js application styled with Tailwind CSS. It allows users to submit Shakespeare text segments, which are then evaluated by an AI model (OpenAI GPT-3) for authenticity and quality. The text segments are stored on the blockchain using the BlockApps API.

### Key Features

- Simple user interface for submitting and viewing Shakespeare text segments
- AI-based scoring system to evaluate the quality and authenticity of submitted text
- Token-based access system to reward contributors and grant access to others' text segments
- Blockchain integration using BlockApps API for secure and transparent data storage
- Overall health rating of the training set data based on the quality of contributed text segments

### Technologies Used

- Next.js: A React framework for building server-side rendered and statically generated web applications
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces
- OpenAI GPT-3: A powerful language model used for evaluating the quality and authenticity of Shakespeare text segments
- BlockApps API: A blockchain platform API for storing and managing text segments on the blockchain

## Getting Started

To run the Silencio POC demo locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-repo/silencio.git`
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up the required environment variables for BlockApps API and OpenAI GPT-3
4. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## Future Enhancements

This POC demo serves as a starting point for the Silencio project. Some potential future enhancements include:

- User authentication and authorization
- More advanced AI scoring models for improved text evaluation
- Search functionality for text segments
- Data visualizations to showcase the growth and quality of the training set over time
- API endpoints for programmatic access to the shared text data
- Enhanced consortium governance model and dispute resolution mechanisms
